            Growing up, I loved building websites.  I taught myself the basics, got ahold of a few Geocities domains and went wild.  I made the kind of ridiculous websites an eight year old would make- and I was enthralled.  Since then, programming has always been something I was interested in.  After studying Economics at New York University and working in finance, I decided to go back to my childhood and what Iâ€™ve always loved.  This led me to Fullstack Academy of Code where I spent 17 weeks learning full stack JavaScript.
            {/*while working in finance I realized how much of the world was rooted in programming and software development  */}
